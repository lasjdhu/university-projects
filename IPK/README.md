### Summary
The IPK25-CHAT protocol defines a high-level behaviour, which can then be implemented on top of one of the well-known transport protocols such as TCP [RFC9293] or UDP [RFC768] [1](#bibliography)

### Usage

#### Prerequisites
- .NET v9.0.203
- CommandLineParser v2.9.2
- Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting v9.0.4
- Microsoft.Extensions.Logging v9.0.4

#### Running application

I prepared `publish` variant to ensure that application behaves consistently on all machines

```sh
make
```

If you prefer, you can also run

```sh
make build
```

And then run your application with .NET runtime, although I haven't tested this option as heavily as `published` version

```sh
dotnet ./src/bin/Release/net9.0/ipk25chat-client.dll
```

### Theory

The application implements a chat client that supports both TCP and UDP protocols. In TCP mode, it maintains a persistent connection with the server using text-based messages. In UDP mode, it uses a more complex approach with dynamic ports and message confirmation.

Both variants support basic chat operations (authentication, joining channels, sending messages) but handle them differently due to the underlying protocol characteristics.

### Source code architecture

I prepared this class diagram to show the main concept behind architecture. I have a `Program.cs` that uses `Utils/` directory
to parse incoming arguments [2](#bibliography). It also defines aaplication logging through a Microsoft extensions [5](#bibliography) I listed in [prerequisites](#prerequisites).
`Program.cs` initializes `TCPClient.cs` [3](#bibliography) or `UDPClient.cs` [4](#bibliography), decides what to do with `stdin` input (sending a message vs command) and
handles graceful shutdown by <C-c> and <C-d> key presses.

Then based on `-t` flag after Network Client is being initialized, it starts to parse user input and sending messages to a server.
Both TCP and UDP clients have their abstract `ClientBase` class, from which they inherit. They support basic `Auth`, `Join`, `Rename` commands.
They can also send plain messages, show `Help` to a user and close connection with a server. Although the complete set of commands works
only in TCP variant. I describe this in a `CHANGELOG.md`.

Both `TCPClient.ts` and `UDPClient.cs` use `TCPMessageHandler.cs` and `UDPMessageHandler.cs`. These files are located in a `Protocol` directory
and they define how exactly the messages that are being sent and received to/from a server look like.

While I implemented the entire application myself, I used Claude AI assistant [6](#bibliography) to help refactor large portions of the code to better align with clean code principles. This included improving variable naming, reducing code repetition, and enhancing overall code structure and readability.

### Testing

#### Initial Testing with Netcat

During early development, netcat was used to verify basic TCP functionality:

```bash
nc -l 4567

./ipk25chat-client -t tcp -s localhost -p 4567
```

For UDP testing:

```bash
nc -u -l 3000

./ipk25chat-client -t udp -s localhost -p 3000 -d 10000 -r 10
```

#### Unit Tests

Usage:

```sh
make test
```

Basic functionality tests using xUnit framework:

```csharp
[Fact]
public void TCPClientCreation() {
  Console.WriteLine("\n=== Testing TCP client creation with host=localhost, port=12345 ===");
  var client = new TCPClient("localhost", 12345, _logger);

  Assert.NotNull(client);
  // Client is created but not connected yet
}
```

#### Integration Testing

The main testing was performed against the reference server:

```bash
./ipk25chat-client -t tcp -s anton5.fit.vutbr.cz -p 4567
```

The TCP implementation proved fully functional with the reference server, supporting all required features (authentication, channel operations, messaging). The UDP implementation showed some limitations that I listed in `CHANGELOG.md`
