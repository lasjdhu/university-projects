# 1. Algorithms (btree, dlist, hashtables, list, queue)

## November 2022

### Description

Functions for:

- Binary search tree
  - recursive
  - iterative
- Linked list
- Double linked list
- Queue
- Hashtable

### Detailed specification

Logical structure, tests, data structures, libraries and prototypes of functions were made by professors at Brno University of Technology.
My work was to write functions itself so program will pass tests.

### Usage

`cd [folder] && make all run tests clean`

# 2. Hamiltonian path and cycle in graph

## December 2022

> A path in a graph in which every vertex occurs exactly once is called a Hamiltonian path. If this path starts and ends at a single vertex, then it is a Hamiltonian cycle in the graph.

### Description [edited as some parts were not included]

Create a program to find a Hamiltonian path (for two given vertices) and a Hamiltonian cycle in an undirected graph.

The project will include loading graphs from a file and appropriate test graphs.

### General information and instructions on replacement projects

The solution will be developed in the C language and will be translatable (using the make command) on the server eva.fit.vutbr.cz. All source codes, header files, test data, etc. will be logically separated and stored in appropriately named subdirectories. The use of non-standard libraries is not allowed. All parts of the variant entry are a necessary part of the solution.

### Usage

`cd graphs && make all run clean`
