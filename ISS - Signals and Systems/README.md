# You can tell by their voice...

## November 2024

### Motivation

One is able to identify the source of the sound by the sound. We can tell a guitar from a piano, a saxophone or an organ. We can safely distinguish the sound a dog makes from the sound a cat makes. Dog owners can distinguish their dog's bark from other dogs, and lovers of songbirds can tell the species of songbird by its song. We know the sound of a truck from a car. We know our friends by their voices. We hear the difference in sounds and can match them to their source or to each other.

And if a slow and imperfect biological human with his ear has such abilities, surely it will be no problem for an infinitely faster and more accurate computer equipped with high quality sensors... Well, we won't go that far, we've separated quality sensors and sound recording from processing, so you won't have to run around Brno recording all sorts of sounds. We have prepared for you engine sounds of several car models at different speeds.

Your task will be to automatically match the recordings coming from one car model. Don't worry, one car is used for all recordings of a given model, so there is no difference between two cars caused by the mileage of the engine or how the owner treated it at the time of the previous recording.
