## 📜 Regarding License(s)

- Some files have Licenses specified in headers, some do not. If you do not see
  a License in header this is _probably_ file I wrote myself
- Some projects contain code provided by professors, identifiable by comments in
  the source files.
- Several projects were team-based. When applicable, I credit my collaborators
  with their GitHub profiles in the corresponding `README.md` files.

- **Note:** Usage of this code may be restricted due to the inclusion of
  professor-contributed code and team project work.
